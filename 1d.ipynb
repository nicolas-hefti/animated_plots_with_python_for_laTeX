    "The idea is to generate animated plots and evtually include them in a [$\\LaTeX$](https://www.latex-project.org/) file. To generate a simple 1D animated plot there are essentially two ways: \n",
    "1. Directly generate the whole animated plot witn Python and save it as a video fomrat, e.g. GIF or MP4; \n",
    "2. Generate a series of plots with python and save them as image format, e.g. PGN, PGF or SVG. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of the first method is that it is a lot faster and probably easier to adjust. Moreover, obviously, you end up with a video that can be played in any reasonable video player. However, the major disadvantage is that I haven't found a good way to implement a GIF or MP4 video into LaTeX. There used to be a nice method using the package [media9](https://ctan.org/pkg/media9?lang=en) which relied on Flash. However since Adobe has ceased support of Flash, see e.g. [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Questions/How_can_I_embed_a_video_in_my_PDF_using_LaTeX%3F), you wont be able to play the video in Adobe Reader. It might still work if you open the file in another reader which supports Flash, I wouldn't know. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second method resolves this major drawback. The video will be played in Adobe Reader as desired as LaTeX creates the animation which does not rely on Flash. Apart from that, another major advantage of the second method is, that it allows you a high degree of freedom. E.g. it is possible to let LaTeX render the text insider your figure which will then be consistent with the rest of your text and, furthermore, also searchable. I'll elaborate that later in greater detail, see in Secion 1.4. For the time being, I'll start with explaining both methods for 1D plots.  "
